# PPSSPP.-PSP+fsr-
Here is the translation of your text into English:


---

I came with the modified PPSSPP version by myself.
In this version, we have fully implemented FSR 1.2.
Due to the strange appearance of the original emulator, I encountered an issue and found a solution.
The fsr1 code or ffx_fsr1.h is integrated into one of the emulator's effects, and by adding aacoler to the fsr page, it works and gives you better frames and visuals.
It significantly impacts the lighting and quality of certain parts of games, but since the game's textures are of low quality, it might not be very noticeable. There is one point:
Try not to increase the graphics and rendering settings unnecessarily. Instead, apply these settings so that you get both quality and optimization.
Set the emulator's graphics to 2x and rendering to 3x.

To enable FSR in the emulator:
Go to Settings > Graphics > Display Load, and in this section, select the aacoler effect.
You can also use another effect that provides very high quality: the PlayStation 4 effect, which I took from a YouTube video and adapted it with FSR 1.2.

I directly integrated these shaders into the emulator.
